### A very random thing that's a bit nonsensical

**The worst things that could happen to a student in a day at school**  (please change anything that you think is not the worst thing that could happen. feel free to change anything)

the longest day which ends at 4:20pm

***first lesson: Math (1hour long)***

You forgot to bring your textbook, notebook and overdue assignments by two weeks.  
You get scolded by teacher
Afterwards, she continues to give more work.
And you have to hand it all up tomorrow.

***second lesson: Geography lesson (1hour 40 minutes)***
Tings start getting good when Ms Ng announces there is a kahoot game.
You are first on the podium with a answer streak of 23 when suddenly.... you just can't tap the correct option. Time is ticking but no matter how hard you try to tap, your phone doesn't respond.  You change the wifi from "Wireless at Dunman_High" to "SWN@SSOE"
and grunt in frustration, willing the timer to slow down but it doesn't.  By the time you do that, the timer is up. Don't fret yet! you are still on the podium, down by four places. You know you have to climb up in the next crucial question with double points. 
You press quickly on the blue square but to your upmost horror, you lost connection again!!!!!!!
After reconnecting, you try the next few options but because of the laggy wifi, your position drops lower, and lower, and lower, and lower, and lower, and lower, and lowe , and lower, and lower, and lower, and lower, and lower, and lower......
Tears of desperation blur your eyes as the spotlight falls on the username which would not have if the wifi hadn't been so rebellious.  Your kick the table leg in frustration
Argh
Aaarrrgghh
AAARRRGGGHHHHH
What a bad day for you!

***RECESS (the supposedly "best" lesson of the day)***

Phone has no battery

You also forgot to bring your wallet and have to borrow money for recess

The queue for your favourite stall is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo long

You wait nevertheless,
and wait,
as the queue before you shortens.
However, to your utmost frustrATION, by the time you reach the counter, most of the food is sold out, leaving..... the worst thing EVER (input food name)
